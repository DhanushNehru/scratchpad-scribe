## üîß Bug Fixes

### Export as PDF
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

- Wrapped PDF generation in a `try/catch` block to prevent the app from going blank during export.
- Added fallback to a **printable popup window** if jsPDF fails (e.g., due to DOM manipulation or concurrency issues).
- Sanitized file names to remove invalid characters.
- User now sees a toast notification confirming successful export or fallback activation.

**How it works:**
1. Click the **Export as PDF** button (FileDown icon) in the sidebar.
2. If successful, a PDF is downloaded automatically.
3. If the PDF generation fails, a new browser tab opens with a printable view of the note.
